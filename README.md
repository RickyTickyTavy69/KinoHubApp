### In this application I have used redux for state management. Redux is the tool which helps you to follow the single responsibility
### principe. I have heard that it is the most important principe in programming.  Using Redux with React allows the programmer to separate
### his UI with "dumb" representative components from his Business logic with the States of Data. This makes the application scalable
### and it is easier to implement tests.

### I have also used materialize css for the modal toasters and ant design for the modal window. The programming language I used is JavaScript.


#### functionality:

#### I have used the create-react-app package to create the main react-app structure. I have used the react-router-dom package to create the routing
#### system. Above in the right corner you can see the navigation. There are three pages: Display, MasterBoard and Sample.
#### The circles on the display page represent the sits in the cinema. Everybody can mark the sits, he wants to book by clicking on them and
#### then place his/her order by clicking on the place order button. Then The user must enter his name and email address to place the order.
#### If the user doesn't enter his name or his email or clicks on the "place order" button without have marked any sits, there will be an
#### error message produced with materialize-css toaster.

#### on the masterBoard page the owner of this website can see all the important data. He can see, how many sits were booked, how many of them
#### Loge and how many are Parkett sits. Also, he can see, how much is the turnover and there is a button which resets all the booked sits.
#### (For more safety there is a modal window and you have to activate three switchers to enable clicking on the button).
